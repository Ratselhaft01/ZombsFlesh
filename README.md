# Overview

In this project I was trying to learn how to use C# and Unity. I wanted to learn how to make a game and discovered for myself how difficult it is. This is a continuing project and will continue to be updated as time goes on.

My game is currently a zombie shooter game, although the scenario might turn to aliens. Either way, the important part is that it is a top down shooter where the player (hopefully players), tries to survive horde after horde of enemies. When the game begins, the player will be alone, but over time, enemies will enter into the world in an attempt to kill the player. Your job is to shoot the enemies and survive.

The purpose for writing this software was to learn Unity more in depth as well as to better learn C#.

# Development Environment

I used Unity and Visual Studio in order to make this project.

I used C# as my programming language and many Unity libraries.

# Useful Websites

* [Unity Documentation](https://docs.unity.com/)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)

# Future Work

* Buildings, I want for the player to be able to control and make buildings.
* I want to add custom sprites in the game rather than simple shapes.
* I want a menu for when the player starts the game and for after they die.
* I would like to also make this multiplayer enabled.
